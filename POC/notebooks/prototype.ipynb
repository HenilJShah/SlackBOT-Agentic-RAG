    "Create an AI agent that leverages the capabilities of a large language model. This agent should be able to extract answers based on the content of a large PDF document and post the results on Slack. Ideally, you use OpenAI LLMs. If you use the Langchain or LLama Index framework to implement this agentic functionality, please donâ€™t use pre-built chains for the task. Implement the logic yourself. Please write production grade code as opposed to scripts as we will be evaluating your code quality.\n"
